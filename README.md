Reddit giveaway/contest winner selection script

This simple script will recursively traverse all comments/replies in a Reddit thread, produce a list of unique entries, and select any number of winners at random. You can configure an array of ineligible usernames, and it will also produce shareable output of the selection and a full list of recognized entries.
